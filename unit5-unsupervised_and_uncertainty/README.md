# K-Means Evaluation and Extension

# Introduction

In situations where you do not have known labeled examples with which to train a model using supervised learning, unsupervised learning models can still be used to classify data, but the classes are discovered rather than prescribed. In this assignment, youll use an unsupervised learning algorithm (k-means) and develop some updates to the AIPython implementation to analyze and improve the algorithms performance. 

# Directions

- If you havent yet, complete the Unit 1 Supplementary Lecture and set up your GitHub account. Also download an IDE, such as Thonny, to use with your GitHub classroom projects.

- You should have already received an email with a link to GitHub classroom online from your instructor. Once you are registered with the class on GitHub classroom you will find options for each of the assignments managed through GitHub classroom for our class. If you want to gain further insight into GitHub as a tool, you can also complete the optional Git & GitHub Fundamentals ungraded assignment in the GitHub classroom menu.

- Use the link for this Assignment #5, create your repository, and open the a5.py file for editing in your IDE and follow the directions in the comments to complete the assignment.

- Commit your code each time you are prompted to in the assignment. The results of the test cases will be available to you each time you make a commit. Make sure your code passes these test cases. When you are finished, submit the last version of a5.py to this assignment.
