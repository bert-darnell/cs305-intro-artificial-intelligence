# Supervised Learning Lab

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will develop python code to apply various supervised learning algorithms to real-world data and compare/analyze the predictive power of these algorithms. In particular, you will gain familiarity with neural networks and the implications of making different choices in specifying network architectures. 

## Directions

- If you haven’t yet, complete the Unit 1 Supplementary Lecture and set up your GitHub account. Also download an IDE, such as Thonny, to use with your GitHub classroom projects. 

- You should have already received an email with a link to GitHub classroom online from your instructor. Once you are registered with the class on GitHub classroom you will find options for each of the assignments managed through GitHub classroom for our class. If you want to gain further insight into GitHub as a tool, you can also complete the optional “Git & GitHub Fundamentals” ungraded assignment in the GitHub classroom menu.

- Use the link for this Assignment #4, create your repository, open the a4.py file for editing in your IDE and follow the directions in the comments to complete the assignment.

- Commit your code each time you are prompted to in the assignment. The results of the test cases will be available to you each time you make a commit. Make sure your code passes these test cases. When you are finished, submit the last version of a4.py to this assignment.
