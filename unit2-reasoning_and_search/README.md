# Assignment - Search

## Introduction

In this assignment you will develop constraints for a CSP solver to solve a significant problem. You will also get practice developing Python code to work with AISpace libraries and leverage the code implementing the AI search algorithms you’ve learned about in this unit. 

## Directions

- If you haven’t yet, complete the Unit 1 Supplementary Lecture and set up your GitHub account. Also download an IDE, such as Thonny, to use with your GitHub classroom projects.
- You should have already received an email with a link to the GitHub classroom online from your instructor. Once you are registered with the class on GitHub classroom you will find options for each of the assignments managed through GitHub classroom for our class. If you want to gain further insight into GitHub as a tool, you can also complete the optional “Git & GitHub Fundamentals” ungraded assignment in the GitHub classroom menu.
- Use the link for Assignment #2, create your repository, open the a2.py file for editing in your IDE and follow the directions in the comments to complete the assignment. 
- Commit your code each time you are prompted to in the assignment. The results of the test cases will be available to you each time you make a commit. Make sure your code passes these test cases. When you are finished, submit the last version of a2.py to this assignment.
