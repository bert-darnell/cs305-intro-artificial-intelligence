# STRIPS Planning Assignment

## Introduction

Planning expands on both propositional logic and search to develop solutions to more complex problems. In this assignment you’ll apply the STRIPS planning methodology to developing a solution to a problem that involves multiple steps. You will write Python code to assist in encoding the problem in STRIPS format and use a STRIPS planner provided by the book authors to solve a problem. 

## Directions

1. If you haven’t yet, complete the Unit 1 Supplementary Lecture and set up your GitHub account. Also download an IDE, such as Thonny, to use with your GitHub classroom projects.

2. You should have already received an email with a link to the GitHub classroom online from your instructor. Once you are registered with the class on GitHub classroom you will find options for each of the assignments managed through GitHub classroom for our class. If you want to gain further insight into GitHub as a tool, you can also complete the optional “Git & GitHub Fundamentals” ungraded assignment in the GitHub classroom menu.

3. Use the link for this Assignment #3, create your repository, open the a3.py file for editing in your IDE and follow the directions in the comments to complete the assignment.

4. Commit your code each time you are prompted to in the assignment. The results of the test cases will be available to you each time you make a commit. Make sure your code passes these test cases. When you are finished, submit the last version of a3.py to this assignment.
